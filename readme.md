### Using service workers with Cloudinary!

#### How to setup a demo

```bash
git clone
```

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```

Demo website is located in ./demo/website</br>
Service Worker code is located in src/sw.js </br>

If you make changes to sw.js and you want to see them in the demo,
you'll need to run an NPM command
```bash
npm run copySW
```

That's required for any change done
